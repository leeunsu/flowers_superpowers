<p>Challenger: A McNair Scholars Paper Series aims to further the access and representation of underrepresented students through the dissemination of research produced by McNair Scholars at UC San Diego. The purpose of this publication is to organize, implement, and maintain a scholarly research journal that represents diverse perspectives across multiple fields of study.</p>

<p>The publicationâ€™s name was inspired by Dr. Ronald E. McNair and his contributions as an outstanding scholar and representative of underrepresented communities of color in higher education. Unfortunately, Dr. McNair passed away in the Challenger space shuttle. This publication was founded to further his legacy of excellence, and to support students who, like Dr. McNair, have the potential to exceed in future doctoral education.</p>
