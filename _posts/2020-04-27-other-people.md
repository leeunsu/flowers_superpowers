# Intro

The main type used throughout the branding is the Baiser family by Apito Foundry. Its diverse collection of fonts has been used as both H1 headers as well as H3 â€” H5. The clean design paved the way for a bolder, more flourishing text: Ogg Italic.

# UX/UI

The objective of this design was for the code to be modular. In doing so would pave way for succeeding developers to carry on the work fluidly. It was built using jekyll. For the end user, it implements [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) (for extended customization and capacity as a headless CMS).
