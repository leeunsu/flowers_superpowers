# Intro

The initial logo was sketched out by the Editor-in-Chief, Nicole Lopez. With this sketch, it was simple to create a clean, balanced logo that would translate well into different sizes and forms. A total of four were finalized into the final branding.

The main type used throughout the branding is the Baiser family by Apito Foundry. Its diverse collection of fonts has been used as both H1 headers as well as H3 â€” H5. The clean design paved the way for a bolder, more flourishing text: Ogg Italic.

# UX/UI

The objective of this design was for the code to be modular. In doing so would pave way for succeeding developers to carry on the work fluidly. It was built using jekyll. For the end user, it implements [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) (for extended customization and capacity as a headless CMS).

The idea of the minimal/brutalist design was to create a space that would spotlight attention to the contributions. It allows for minimal distractions and focuses on the readership and viewership of the artists.
