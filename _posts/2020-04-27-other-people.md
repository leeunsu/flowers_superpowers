# Intro

The initial logo was sketched out by the Editor-in-Chief, Nicole Lopez. With this sketch, it was simple to create a clean, balanced logo that would translate well into different sizes and forms. A total of four were finalized into the final branding.

# Typography

The main type used throughout the branding is the Baiser family by Apito Foundry. Its diverse collection of fonts has been used as both H1 headers as well as H3 and H4. The clean design paved the way for a bolder, more flourishing text: Ogg Italic. Ogg Italic fills the space of the H2 header, coupling with Basier Regular.

# UX/UI

One objective of this design was for the code to be modular. In doing so would pave way for succeeding developers to carry on the work fluidly. It was built using jekyll. For the end user, it implements [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) (for extended customization and capacity as a headless CMS).

Another objective of this design was the usability, focused on readers. The idea of the minimal/brutalist design was to create a space that would spotlight attention to the contributions. It allows for minimal distractions and focuses on the readership and viewership. As a perk, at the bottom right of the screen is a fixed toggle for light and dark mode. This is also defaulted to the user's default device setting (in case they already have a preference).

Though the frontend may be simple, the code for the blog was written from the ground up, creating a website that fluidly groups and categorizes the contributions into its respective poetry, fiction, nonfiction, and visual art containers.
