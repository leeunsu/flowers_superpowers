# Intro/Wireframing

The objective of this project was to create a more user-friendly and approachable experience for Craigslist. On first doing my research, I found that the listings being front and center of the homepage to be refreshing and practical. However, the search bar felt a little too tucked into the corner for a site where the search function hold a lot of significance. Using these traits as a starting point, I created a homepage that spotlights both the search function as well as the listings. There were some liberties taken by putting all the listings into a dropdown menu within the search bar, but having the element be hoverable, I felt, would keep with the ease of use and practicality.

Turning the listings into a dropdown menu enabled the website to have extra space. For this, I decided to design a community experience for the users. By selecting one of the categories from the dropdown menu would open a space for that particular category (all categories if "all" is selected). This compartmentalization of categories was inspired a lot by Reddit and its subreddits. I hoped to build a product like theirs where community engagement is principle in the design.
