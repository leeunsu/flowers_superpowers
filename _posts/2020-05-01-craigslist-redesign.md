# Intro/Wireframing

The objective of this project was to create a more user-friendly and approachable homepage experience for Craigslist. When first doing my research, I found that the listings being front and center of the homepage to be refreshing and practical. However, the search bar felt a little too tucked into the corner for a site where the search function holds a lot of significance. This made it difficult to discern how the elements on either side of the sidebar was prioritized. I also noticed, when making a new listing, the current UX shuffled through 5 pages â€” I wanted this to be 1. So, I set off with these in mind:

* Bring the search bar front and center; keep this input field active when first entering the site.
* Make a space for each category so that it is easier for the community to engage with what they are most interested in.
* Create a more intuitive user flow for creating a new post (try to make it singe-page).

Using these as a starting point, I created a homepage that spotlights both the search function as well as the categories/subcategories. There were some liberties taken by putting all the categories into a dropdown menu within the search bar, but having the element be hoverable, I felt, would keep with the ease-of-use while boosting practicality and design.

Turning the listings into a dropdown menu enabled the website to have extra space. And for this, I decided to design a community experience for the users. By selecting one of the categories from the dropdown menu would open a space for that particular category (all categories if "all" is selected). This compartmentalization of categories was inspired by Reddit and its subreddits. I hoped to build a similar product where community engagement is principle in the design.

I was also able to create a "create post" module using a single-page overlay. To do this, I researched the ease and convenience of other popular sites like facebook, twitter, and reddit. However, with all the information needed to create a Craigslist posting (especially to allow posts from users without accounts), the module had to be larger to fit all the fields. To do this, I created a postcard-esque design, keeping metadata fields at the left and making a body field at the right. I also minimized any non-essentials into an "advanced" menu (i.e for phone numbers and addresses).
