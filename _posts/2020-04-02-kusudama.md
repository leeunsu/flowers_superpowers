# Intro

Sun God Festival is a student-curated, daylong music and arts festival at UC San Diego. Named as one of Live Nation’s “Top 5 College Concerts That Should Be Actual Festivals”, Sun God Festival is continuously reimagined to deliver students with thrilling moments and life-long memories from live performances by national touring artists, diverse food vendors, vibrant art and décor, and interactive brand activations.

In the spring of 2019, I had the opportunity to lead in the creative direction and web design of UC San Diego's Sun God Festival. During the course of this project, I worked closely with the team behind A.S. Concerts and Events as well as A.S. Graphic Studio's webmaster, Emily Nguyen. Together, we were able to successfully create a beautiful and unforgettable Sun God Festival. Thank you to everyone who was on the team.
