# Intro

Sun God Festival is a student-curated, daylong music and arts festival at UC San Diego. Named as one of Live Nation’s “Top 5 College Concerts That Should Be Actual Festivals”, Sun God Festival is continuously reimagined to deliver students with thrilling moments and life-long memories from live performances by national touring artists, diverse food vendors, vibrant art and décor, and interactive brand activations.

# Contributions

In the spring of 2019, I had the opportunity to lead in the creative direction and web design of UC San Diego's Sun God Festival. During the course of this project, I worked closely with the team behind A.S. Concerts and Events as well as A.S. Graphic Studio's webmaster, [Emily Nguyen](http://emilynguyen.co). Together, we were able to successfully create a beautiful and unforgettable Sun God Festival. Thank you to everyone who was on the team.

# Direction

Initially, It was a challenge determining the direction of this project. Being a festival taking place in La Jolla, I knew that I wanted to include coastal elements into the overall aesthetic (just as Splash House was designed harmonious to its Palm Springs locale). Using that as a stepping stone, I explored the environment and scene of La Jolla, going hiking on the Torrey Pines Trail and spending time at The Village.

The identity of Sun God took a shift after I attended Trevor Paglen's _Site Unseen_ installation at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD). What I found intriguing of his piece was the binary between the things visible in the tanglible world opposed to artificial intellgence.

> "Paglen’s photographs show something we are not meant to see, whose concealment he regards as symptomatic of the historical moment we inhabit. His objects act in opposition to what his images have exposed, imagining another and potentially different world. Paglen is a conceptual artist with activist intentions. Helping to better see the particular moment we live in and producing spaces in which to envision alternative futures are among his chief concerns."

Using Paglen's work as an influence, I decided on creating a binary between the La Jolla obsucra and a digital obscura. I added components of camera viewfinders, auto/manual focus, and blurring to illustrate this. In between the two is where I implemented the glitches, stretching photos and pixel sorting through [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/). I wanted to convey a new emotion of festival culture through memory, whether it was the memory processes by our minds or by the memory contained within the chassis of a camera.

# UX/UI

[Visit website]()

Sun God Festival's website was inspired in the same way. I wanted to design interactive elements throughout the page that would convey the direction I had in my head. With the help of Emily as a developer, we were able to create a unique online experience for the festival. This project was built on Jekyll and SASS.
