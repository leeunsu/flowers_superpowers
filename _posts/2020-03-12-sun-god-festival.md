contributions: |-
  In the spring of 2019, I had the opportunity to lead in the creative direction and web design of UC San Diego's Sun God Festival. During the course of this project, I worked closely with the team behind A.S. Concerts and Events as well as A.S. Graphic Studio's webmaster, Emily Nguyen. Together, we were able to successfully create a beautiful and unforgettable Sun God Festival.

  Thank you to everyone who was on the team.
