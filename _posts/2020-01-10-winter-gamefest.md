  San Diego's Sixth College Technology Committee. They host several different tournaments
  accompanied by great music and free play area for all attendees. By facilitating
  face-to-face gaming, they bring members of the video gaming community together in
  a celebration of gaming culture and tradition. The first WGF was held in 2005 and
  had less than 30 attendees. Last year, about 2,000 people attended Winter GameFest.
  They held 14 tournaments and ample opportunity for drop-in play. Winter GameFest
  has grown to be one of the largest student-run events on campus, and is a premier
  competitive video game event in Southern California.
